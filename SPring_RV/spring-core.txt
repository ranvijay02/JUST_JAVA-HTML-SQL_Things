Spring Notes:
xml tags : <beans> root tag
<bean> has attributes id and class
id is referred in program
    Employee emp = (Employee) ctx.getBean("emp");
class has the fully qualified name of class
   com.deloitte.bean.Employee
<bean> has subtags
  <property> for each property of class
  name and value are attributes
Putting together all beans/components is called Spring wiring
IOC - inversion of control 
If a bean refers to another bean, ref="idofbean"
